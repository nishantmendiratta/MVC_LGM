#####MVC_LGM - MVC Framework
MVC Stands for Model, View, Controller. It's a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces. This is the simplest MVC framework to understand.
<ul>
<li>View  - The view requests information from the model that it uses to generate an output representation to the user.This file includes all HTML markups and it could also include scripts. </li> 
<li>Model - The model notifies its associated views and controllers when there has been a change in its state.</li> 
<li>Controller - The controller communicates with the model and the view. </li> 
</ul>
######NOTE :- Model and View can't communicated directly.

#####Directory Structure
<ul>
<li>root[files] > .htaccess,index.php</li>
<li>root[folders] > application,shell</li>
</ul>
